In order to keep things simple for the end user, less complicated to maintain on the technical
side, but also provide some flexibility over how content can be uploaded to S3, there is no
prescribed user interface. Any S3 compatible client can be used to interact with DuraCloud.

We believe this is the right choice because there are many popular, well supported and
battle-tested options already available. However we provide streamlined documentation for
the use of the open source program Cyberduck as a GUI option and the AWS CLI for command line
usage.

Hereâ€™s a list of clients that have been used or tested by Lyrasis staff:

- [AWS cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)
- [S3Browser](https://s3browser.com/) **(Windows only)**

But there are many others and you are free to use any S3 compatible client that you prefer.
