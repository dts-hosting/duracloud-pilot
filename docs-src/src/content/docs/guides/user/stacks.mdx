If you need to partition access to files by user, or require a very large number of buckets,
you will need to use multiple stacks.

Depending on the deployment strategy multiple stacks may be deployed to:

a) a single account, or

b) separate AWS accounts.

### Single account

In this case each user can be assigned to access one or more stacks within the same account.
You will use one set of credentials for all the stacks you have access to.

### Separate accounts

In this case you will receive one set of credentials for each account you have access to.
Within each account you will have access to one or more stacks.

Those are the standard deployment paths but consult with your IT support or service provider on the best approach for your use case and which options they provide.
