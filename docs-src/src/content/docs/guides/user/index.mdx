Whoever is responsible for deploying DuraCloud will provide access credentials to users. As
a user you should receive an access key and secret, which serves as a username and password
for interacting with S3.

**It is important to treat this as sensitively as you would any username and password.**

You should also a recieve a "stack name". This will typically be in the form `duracloud-$ID`
where `$ID` is an identifier assigned by those handling the deployment. It is important to know
this because your user will only be able to interact with a subset of buckets in an AWS account
that are prefixed with that stack name. You will also see references to “stack name” throughout
the documentation.

Before proceeding confirm you have received:

- access key (username)
- access secret (password)
- stack prefix (`duracloud-$ID`)
