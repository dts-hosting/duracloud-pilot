When you view s3 using a GUI client or the AWS CLI for the first time in a new account
you will notice a number of pre-existing buckets that have been created.

- `aws-sam-*`: this is a deployment artifact bucket only. It is inaccessible.
- `duracloud-$ID-bucket-requested`: this bucket is used to make requests to create new buckets.
- `duracloud-$ID-logs`: this bucket collects raw audit trail events from AWS. It is inaccessible.
- `duracloud-$ID-managed`: this bucket is used to deposit generated files such as audit history, exports, inventory and reports. It is read only.

The `duracloud-$ID-managed` bucket will use these prefixes (folders) at least, over time:

- `audit`: audit logs
- `bucket-requested`: receives status reports on bucket creation request outcomes
- `exports`: csv of checksum status checks and schedules
- `inventory`: receives inventory csv files per user bucket created
- `reports`: storage reports in html format

*Note: if the AWS account is used for other purposes besides DuraCloud it's possible that
other buckets may also exist. This will also be the case if there are multiple stacks per
account. However the access credentials given out for using DuraCloud will only work with
the eligible stack resources associated with the user credentials.*
