title: Lyrasis Hosting
---

DuraCloud is open source and freely available for anyone to deploy into their own AWS account.

However Lyrasis provides a hosted option for anyone or institutions wanting a managed service.

The primary benefits are:

- Lyrasis manages an AWS account for you and this account can be transferred to your ownership at any time.
- All of the setup, configuration, monitoring etc. is not your responsibility. Lyrasis handles all of it for you.
- You receive access keys and secrets (usernames and passwords) for interacting with S3 but don’t need anything else besides an s3 client.
- For issues or questions you receive technical support from experienced hosting team staff members.
- It’s a very simple option for providing you or your users file upload capabilities for long term preservation purposes.

For pricing information and other details see the [Lyrasis DuraCloud hosting](#) page.
