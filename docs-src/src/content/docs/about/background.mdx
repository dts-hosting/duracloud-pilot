title: Why DuraCloud?

In the digital era, ensuring that critically important documents remain safe and available is a continual challenge.
Physical computing hardware that is used to create and store documents can fail or become obsolete very quickly,
providing a need for tools to ensure that these documents remain available.

There are many options for file storage and backup, with a growing trend toward the use of service providers offering
off-site storage and backup solutions. These solutions are enticing, but several concerns often remain:

- I just want to upload files to a storage service, how can I do this in a simple and reliable way?
- How do I ensure that files remain intact over time after I have transferred them to the storage service?
- How do I ensure that the storage service that I am using receives a copy of my local files?
- How do I retrieve my content once it is stored?
- How do I recover a file if it has been overwritten or corrupted?
- How do I make my content publicly accessible at a stable url?

How does DuraCloud solve these problems?

## Amazon S3

DuraCloud is designed using [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), a robust and internationally
distributed file storage service. You can think of DuraCloud as being in large part an extension of S3
that handles these concerns:

1. Configuring more "complex" aspects of S3 to support storage and preservation goals.
2. Providing additional value-added features via a set of scheduled tasks.

**Ultimately, the goal of DuraCloud is to make the use of Amazon S3 easy for users and robust for preservation.**

### Configuration

Principally, these bucket configurations are automatically applied as buckets are created:

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Versioning">
        Versioning is enabled. This supports file restore for up to 2 days post update (via request).

        [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html)
    </Card>

    <Card title="Lifecycle transitions">
        Files are uploaded to the standard storage tier and transition to the Glacier Instant
        Retrieval tier after 3 days.

        [Learn more](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/)
    </Card>

    <Card title="Inventory">
        A file manifest is generated for each user created bucket.

        [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-inventory.html)
    </Card>

    <Card title="Audit">
        A request log is generated for each user created bucket.

    </Card>

    <Card title="Replication">
        User uploaded files are copied to Glacier Deep Archive storage for backup and disaster recovery (latter via
        request).

        [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html)
    </Card>

    <Card title="Public access">
        Buckets can be created as publicly accessible then files will be available using a url. Files will
        be stored in the standard storage tier and not transitioned to Glacier, however replication will still
        occur and the backup files will be stored in Glacier.

    </Card>

    <Card title="Selectable region">
        Files can be stored in any AWS region supported by the infrastructure team or service provider.

<Aside>
    A "request" is made to whoever manages the DuraCloud deployment on behalf of users. An end user cannot perform the
    action directly.

### Scheduled tasks

In addition, these operations are run on a schedule:

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Fixity checks">
        Performs checksum verification every 6 months.
    </Card>

    <Card title="File manifest">
        Generated on a nightly basis via the inventory configuration.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Audit log">
        Generated and delivered within hours of requests via logging configuration.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Storage report">
        Generated on a weekly basis.
    </Card>
