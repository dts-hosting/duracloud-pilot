title: Why DuraCloud?

import { Aside, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In the digital era, ensuring that critically important documents remain safe and available is a continual challenge.
Physical computing hardware that is used to create and store documents can fail or become obsolete very quickly,
providing a need for tools to ensure that these documents remain available.

There are many options for file storage and backup, with a growing trend toward the use of service providers offering
off-site storage and backup solutions. These solutions are enticing, but several concerns often remain:

- How do I upload files to the storage service in a simple and reliable way?
- How do I ensure that files remain intact over time after I have transferred them to the storage service?
- How do I ensure that the storage service that I am using receives a copy of my local files?
- How do I retrieve my content once it is stored?
- How do I recover a file if it has been overwritten or corrupted?
- How do I make my content publicly accessible at a stable url?
- How am I protected against the storage service becoming obsolete or going away?

DuraCloud can help to solve these problems.

## Amazon S3

DuraCloud is designed using [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), a robust and internationally
distributed file storage service. You can think of DuraCloud as being in large part an extension of S3
that handles these concerns:

1. Configuring more "complex" aspects of S3 to support storage and preservation goals.
2. Providing additional value-added features via a set of scheduled tasks.

Preservation services are intended for long-term storage and future access, and while the technology for
many of these services has been impressive, the sustainability of the services themselves has been less so.
Building DuraCloud as a form of S3 proxy service backed by Amazon's global infrastructure, we
believe, provides one of the best guarantees for long-term sustainability and access to the files you
are storing.

**Ultimately, the goal of DuraCloud is to make the use of Amazon S3 easy for users and robust for preservation.**

### Configuration

Principally, these bucket configurations are automatically applied as buckets are created:

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Access Control">
        Users can be "standard" or "power" users. The former can list and upload files but
        cannot download or delete them. The latter can do all of the above.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Versioning">
        Versioning is enabled. This supports file restore for up to 2 days post update (via request).

        [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html)
    </Card>

    <Card title="Lifecycle transitions">
        Files are uploaded to the standard storage tier and transition to the Glacier Instant
        Retrieval tier after 7 days.

        [Learn more](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/)
    </Card>

    <Card title="Inventory">
        A file manifest is generated for each user created bucket.

        [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-inventory.html)
    </Card>

    <Card title="Audit">
        A request log is generated for each user created bucket.

        [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html)
    </Card>

    <Card title="Replication">
        User uploaded files are copied to Glacier Deep Archive storage for backup and disaster recovery (latter via
        request).

        [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html)
    </Card>

    <Card title="Public access">
        Buckets can be created as publicly accessible then files will be available using a url. Files will
        be stored in the standard storage tier and not transitioned to Glacier, however replication will still
        occur and the backup copies will be stored in Glacier.

    </Card>

    <Card title="Selectable region">
        Files can be stored in any AWS region supported by the infrastructure team or service provider.

<Aside>
    A "request" is made to whoever manages the DuraCloud deployment on behalf of users. An end user cannot perform the
    action directly.

### Scheduled tasks

In addition, these operations are run on a schedule:

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Fixity checks">
        Performs checksum verification for each file every 6 months.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Checksum export">
        Checksum metadata for all files is exported every month.
    </Card>

    <Card title="File manifest">
        Generated on a nightly basis via the inventory configuration.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Audit log">
        Generated and delivered within hours of requests via logging configuration.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Storage report">
        Generated on a weekly basis.
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

<Aside>Generated files are retained for 30 days.</Aside>
