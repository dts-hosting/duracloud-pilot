# DuraCloud Documentation

DuraCloud is a set of additions to Amazon S3 storage, deployed within an AWS account,
to help fulfill preservation goals.

It is intended to be a very simple service for the end user that configures advanced
features automatically with no expert knowledge of AWS or S3 required. This enables
the user, who only wants to upload files, to feel confident that those files are
being stored resiliently.
